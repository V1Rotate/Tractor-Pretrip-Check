Truck image and Bison Transport logo are open source media. 

This is the application for a truck driver, in this case, Freightliner Cascadia truck. Driver gets a list of the check-points he should check before the departure and 
his trip. If found this list of check-point at the open source. If any check point is not applicable for the specific truck and its modification, the driver can remove 
any point from the list not make him confused later and to make the list look cleaner. Driver toggle each check-point once its checked on the truck, and that check point 
on the list gets a green color bar on the left side indicating that this exact task is completed.

Application can be closed once all the tasks completed (all the points checked).

In case, the driver is not sure about any task and would like to remind anything technical stuff regarding his Freightliner Cascadia, he can open the Driver's Manual 
by clicking the 'Driver's Manual' button in the Header - driver will be routed to the Freightliner truck official driver's manual.
